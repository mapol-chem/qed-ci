- H2_FCI_TDM.ipynb runs FCI/cc-pVTZ calculation on H2 at equilibrium geometry and gets first few states and transition dipole moments.  Output stored in H2_FCI_ccpVTZ.out

- H2_CASSCF_TDM.ipynb runs SA-CASSCF(2,2)/cc-pVTZ on H2 at equilibrium geometry and gets first few states and transition dipole moments.  Average is taken over roots 0 and 1.  Output is H2_CASSCF_ccpVTZ.out


- H2_Dimer_FCI_TDM.ipynb runs FCI/cc-pVTZ calculation on H2 dimer, each at equilibrium geometry, but dimers separated by 1000 Angstroms and gets first few states and transition dipole moments.  Output stored in H2_Dimer_FCI_ccpVTZ.out

- H2_Dimer_CASSCF_TDM.ipynb runs SA-CASSCF(4,4)/cc-pVTZ on H2 dimer, each at equilibrium geometry but dimers separated by 1000 Angstroms, and gets first few states and transition dipole moments.  Average is taken over roots 0, 1, and 2.  Output is H2_Dimer_CASSCF_ccpVTZ.out
